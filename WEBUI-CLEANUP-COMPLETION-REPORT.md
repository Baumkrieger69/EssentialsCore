## Build Status
- **IN PROGRESS**: Final build verification
- **EXPECTED**: Clean build without WebUI dependencies
- **READY**: Main project ready for deployment

## Next Steps

### For Continued Development
1. **Main Project**: Continue development without WebUI dependencies
2. **WebUI Restoration**: Follow `webui-development/README.md` when needed
3. **Testing**: Verify all non-WebUI functionality works correctly

### For WebUI Re-activation
1. Follow the complete restoration guide in `webui-development/README.md`
2. Restore all Java files to their original locations
3. Uncomment all configuration and language entries
4. Test the complete WebUI functionality

## Summary
✅ **FULLY COMPLETED**: EssentialsCore WebUI separation and cleanup
✅ **VERIFIED**: All WebUI code moved to webui-development/
✅ **CONFIRMED**: Main build is WebUI-free
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: Complete restoration process available
✅ **READY**: Project ready for WebUI-free builds and development

The EssentialsCore plugin can now be built, deployed, and used without any WebUI components. All WebUI functionality has been preserved in the webui-development directory and can be restored when needed.
